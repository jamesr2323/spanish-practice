# Spanish Practice

I created this application to help me (and hopefully others) some practice listening to real Spanish audio, and improving the ability to hear what is being said.

It uses freely available TV programs from rtve.es along with their subtitles to create 'listening challenge' exercises.

# Deployment

Go to a RTVE.es video page with a video that has subtitles. Most do. E.g. http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/acacias-38/acacias-38-capitulo-343/3705758/?

Once the video is loaded, then just copy and paste the code in app.js into the console and run.
